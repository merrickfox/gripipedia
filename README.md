An app to categorize Brazilian Jiu Jitsu video techniques for easier discovery.

## Tech Stack
* React (server rendered with next.js)
* Redux
* NodeJS
* Express
* GraphQL
* Apollo
* ES6

## Instructions To Run
`npm install` in both app and api folders (really should be two seperate repos... TODO)

You will need a postgres DB running with the details as configured in api/models/index.js, or reconfigure as you like.

Run the server with `npm start` in the api folder

Run the client with `npm dev start` in the app folder
